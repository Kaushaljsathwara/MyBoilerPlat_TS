Hei
Helloa sweden,
I'm kaushal sathwara, I'm a hybrid mobile application developer. Currently, my domain is "Banking and capital market". I have a total of 8.9 years of experience in developing mobile applications for both Android & iOS. For the last 5.6 years, I've been working with React Native only. If we talk about my current skills set then it's React Native, Redux, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Currently working with Persistent Systems as an Engineering Lead position. It's a global company that was founded in 1990.

If we talk about my achievements then last year in my current organization I got two awards. 

One is the "Bravo individual" award for delivery of on-time high-quality work. And 2nd is Being identified as the Top Talent award for the last financial year. I'm getting this award from among 15 thousend + employees.

So this type of achievement is my main motivation and passion for solving complex problems and creating innovative solutions.

And If I talk about Sweden from what I have read and researched I like your culture, environment, and work-life balance and benefits provided by the government. And I'm sure my wife and my one kid loved it and enjoyed it over there.

If you have any questions then I'm happy to answer them.

Vi ses.
